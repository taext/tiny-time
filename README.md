# TINY TIME

 

Tiny Time is a short-form time notation for hackers and painters: 1-5 characters of length.

Might find use in creative minds, tight spaces, repetitive tasks, and geeky watches.

### z:1 NOTATION

 

z:1 notation is base 60, lining everything up nicely with the alpha-numeric characters:

        'a' through 'y' is 1-25
         Zero is 'z'
        'A' through 'Y' is 26-50
         '9' through '1' is 51-59 (minutes only: 'nine minutes to' through 'one minute to')
