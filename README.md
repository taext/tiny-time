#TINY TIME

 

Tiny Time™ is a short form time notation for hackers and painters: 1-5 characters of length.

Might find use in creative minds, tight spaces, repetitive tasks, and geeky watches.

###Z-Y NOTATION

 

Z-Y Notation is base 25, lining everything up nicely with the English alphabet:

        'a' through 'y' is 1-25
         Zero is 'z'
        'A' through 'Y' is 26-50
         51 is '9', 59 is '1' (minutes only: 'nine minutes to' and 'one minute to')
